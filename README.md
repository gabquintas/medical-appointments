# Medical Appointments Project

This is project is part of Udacity's Data Science Foundations Nanodegree. In this project, I analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings using a Jupyter Notebook. I used the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

I went through the entire data analysis process for this end, including:

<ul>
<li> Asking questions</li>
<li> Wrangling data</li>
<li>Performing EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)</li>
<li>Drawing conclusions</li>
<li> Communicating results</li>
</ul>

More information about each step is contained in the project's Jupyter Notebook.
